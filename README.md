Hope this will help my friend to find another job, this just a mere nothing to help them, but I hope I could do something for them

This is the tech stack is used

Enginer input Form --> HR Employee Master Data -> Google Sheet as DB -> Transformed into API using steinhq -> scheduled to store into Notion -> Notion TalentDB

previously, it tooks 5000 second to proceed 740 data, and I change this with async process, and it tooks only 25 second O(1)
